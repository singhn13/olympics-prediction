# Predicting Winners of the Olympics


The culmination of international sports achievements, the Olympic Games play a key role in the cultural life of a global community. For this project, I wanted to analyze the indirect agents that can increase a country's chances of winning. In particular, I sought answers to three questions with my knowledge of Data Science and Analysis. These include:

1. Does the host country have an advantage over the other participating countries?
2. Does an equal ratio of women to men participating in the Olympics play with a country's odds?
3. Does the GDP per capita affect a country's performance?
